# NewsScraper
Scrapes the Top Stories from the AP website and displays the headline and summary text. Allows users to select particular stories to be saved for later.
On the back end, all stories are saved to the database anyway, whether saved for a particular user or not. The database does still keep trakc of which storries have been saved by a particular user though.

#### Note
The AP spends a lot of money generating this content and deserves the ad money generated from viewing these stories on thier own website. This app exists for demonstration purposes only.
